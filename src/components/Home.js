        <br></br>

     <b> - within 8 hours : </b> Your carbon monoxide levels will return to normal, and your oxygen levels will continue to climb.
     <br></br> 
     <br></br>
     <b> - in 24 hours:</b>  As nicotine amounts in the bloodstream decrease, veins and arteries become less constricted, allowing more oxygen to pass through.
     <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <b>  - within 48 hours:</b>  Taste and scent improve and nerve endings will begin regeneration process after being damaged by the effects of smoking 
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <b>  -  in 72 hours: </b> The bronchial tubes within the lungs have begun to relax and open up further, increasing lung capacity.
     <br></br>
     <br></br>
     <b>  - within 2 weeks : </b> Breathing and movement improves. Improved ventilation and oxygenation are to blame for this. Additionally, the lung capacity improves by up to 30%.
     <br></br>
     <br></br>
     <b>  - within 3 months: </b> Sinus inflammation and shortness of breath have decreased. Lung fibers that assist in lung health are regenerating.
     <br></br>
